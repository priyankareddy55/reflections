How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

    It did a lot because manual comparison can be tiresome and inefficient.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

    Access to the older versions of a file can help you to easily revert back to any older versions at any time just like a undo button.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

    I think it is a good idea to manually choose when to save because this wouldn't create unnecessary commits and we can make sure that each commit is more valid and represents a good logical change.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
